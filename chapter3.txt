# Branching in git

1. to check the branches: git branch (* is followed by the current branch)
2. to create new branch: git branch BRANCH_NAME
3. to switch to new branch: git checkout BRANCH_NAME
4. so the updated/new file will staged to that branch where it is added: git add FILENAME
5. to add the changes mades in files in other branch to our main branch:-
    i. go to main branch: git checkout main
    ii. execute: git merge BRANCH_NAME
6. want to push this into your github repo:-
    i. first, bring the remote changes into your local branch: git pull origin main 
        (if there are changes which you have done in your local repo but not pushed it to the github)
    ii. git push origin main
