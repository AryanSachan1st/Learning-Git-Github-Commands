How to check which remote github account is linked to my code base - 
1. Inside your project folder:
    >>> git remote -v
    Output:
    origin  https://github.com/AryanSachan1st/repo_name.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/AryanSachan1st/repo_name.git (push)

    Meaning:
    origin → remote name
    AryanSachan1st → GitHub username (account linked)
    ChatBot-VIT → repo name

    So this repo is connected to:
    👉 https://github.com/AryanSachan1st/ChatBot-VIT

2. Check which Git identity is used for commits :
    >>> git config user.name
    >>> git config user.email

    Output:
    your_username
    your_email@gmail.com

    Meaning:
    commit author name
    commit email (must match GitHub account email to show contributions)

3. Check whether you are authenticated or not (using SSH):
    >>> ssh -T git@github.com
    
    Output:
    Hi your_github_username! You've successfully authenticated...

To change remote repo- 
Remove old remote + add new one (clean reset)
    >>> git remote remove origin
    >>> git remote add origin https://github.com/YourNewUsername/NewRepo.git
    >>> git push -u origin main/master (set ur branch)
