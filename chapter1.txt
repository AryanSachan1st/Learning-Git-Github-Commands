Hello, this is Aryan Sachan, feel free to learn about git and github-
#Git commit flow-
1. create and edit the file.
2. git init - to initialize git
3. git status - to see the untracked files
4. git add FILENAME - add the untracked files in the staging env
5. git commit -m "commit message in present tense"
6. git log - see the status

#some changes made to a file
#To restore the prev version of that file-
8. git status - to see which file is changed (in red)
9. git diff FILENAME - see the original text (red) and changes made (green)
10. git restore FILENAME

#To check all the commits-
11. git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate

#To remove some files from staging env- (after you have executed git add file1 file2 .....)
12. git restore --staged file1 file2 .....

# Note: to select all the files in the current dir, use '.' in place of 'filenames'
