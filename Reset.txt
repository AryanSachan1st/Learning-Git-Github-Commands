Git Reset Command Explanation

The `git reset` command is a powerful tool used to undo changes by moving the current branch pointer (HEAD) backward to a previous commit.

Syntax:
  git reset --<level> HEAD~<n>

Where:
  <level> : The mode of reset (soft, mixed, hard).
  HEAD~<n>: The target commit to reset to.

---

Understanding HEAD~n
HEAD refers to the current commit you are on.
HEAD~1 (or HEAD^) refers to the direct parent of the current commit (1 commit back).
HEAD~2 refers to the grandparent of the current commit (2 commits back).
HEAD~n refers to the nth ancestor of the current commit.

The 3 Levels of Git Reset

1. Soft Reset (--soft)
   Command: git reset --soft HEAD~n
   
   - Effect:
     - Moves the HEAD pointer back to the specified commit.
     - Staging Area (Index): UNTOUCHED (files at the staging area remains untouched).
     - Working Directory: UNTOUCHED (your files remain as they were).
   
   - Use Case:
     - When you want to squash the last few commits into one, or simply undo a commit command but keep the work ready to be committed again.

2. Mixed Reset (--mixed) [DEFAULT]
   Command: git reset --mixed HEAD~n
   (or simply: git reset HEAD~n)
   
   - Effect:
     - Moves the HEAD pointer back to the specified commit.
     - Staging Area (Index): RESET (changes from the undone commits differ from the index, so they appear as "unstaged" changes).
     - Working Directory: UNTOUCHED (your files remain as they were).
   
   - Use Case:
     - When you want to undo a commit and also unstage the files, allowing you to review your work before deciding what to stage again.

3. Hard Reset (--hard)
   Command: git reset --hard HEAD~n
   
   - Effect:
     - Moves the HEAD pointer back to the specified commit.
     - Staging Area (Index): RESET to match the target commit.
     - Working Directory: RESET to match the target commit.
   
   - WARNING:
     - This is DESTRUCTIVE. Any changes in the working directory or staging area that were not committed will be LOST permanently.
   
   - Use Case:
     - When you want to completely discard recent commits and all current changes, returning the project state exactly to how it was at the specified commit.
