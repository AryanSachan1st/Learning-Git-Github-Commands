RESTORING DELETED FILES/FOLDERS FROM REMOTE TO LOCAL
======================================================

This guide explains how to restore files or folders that have been deleted from your local repository, covering various scenarios.

1. RESTORE FROM REMOTE (Undo Local Deletion)
--------------------------------------------
If you have deleted a file locally but HAVE NOT committed the deletion yet, you can simply restore it from the latest commit (HEAD).

Command:
  git restore <file_name>
  # OR (older syntax)
  git checkout -- <file_name>

If you want to discard ALL local changes (including all deletions) and make your local branch exactly match the remote branch:

Commands:
  git fetch origin
  git reset --hard origin/<your_branch_name>
  # Example: git reset --hard origin/main

WARNING: `git reset --hard` will permanently delete any uncommitted local changes.

2. RE-CLONE THE REPOSITORY
--------------------------
If your local repository is corrupted or you want a fresh start, you can re-clone the entire repository. This will download everything from the remote GitHub repository.

Steps:
1. Delete the existing local project folder.
2. Open your terminal/command prompt.
3. Run the clone command:
   git clone <repository_url>

3. RESTORE SPECIFIC FOLDERS ONLY
--------------------------------
If you want to restore a specific folder from the remote repository (e.g., from the `main` branch) without resetting your entire project.

Command:
  git checkout origin/<branch_name> -- <folder_path>

Example:
  # helper-scripts is the folder name
  git checkout origin/main -- helper-scripts/

This command grabs the version of the folder from the remote reference and places it in your current working directory. The changes are automatically staged (added to the index).

4. HOW TO RESTORE IF DELETION IS ALREADY COMMITTED
--------------------------------------------------
If you have already committed the deletion (and potentially pushed it to GitHub), the file is gone from the "current" version. You need to retrieve it from a previous point in history.

Steps:
1. Find the commit hash where the file still existed.
   - You can use `git log` or look at the "History" on GitHub to find the commit ID (SHA) *before* the deletion.

2. Checkout the file/folder from that specific commit.
   
   Command:
     git checkout <commit_hash> -- <path_to_file_or_folder>
   
   Example:
     git checkout 5d8f3a1 -- src/components/Header.js

3. The file is now restored to your working directory and staged.
4. Commit the restoration.
   
   git commit -m "Restored deleted file"
   git push origin <branch_name>

5. RESTORING MULTIPLE FILES/FOLDERS
-----------------------------------
If you need to restore multiple specific files or folders at once.

Scenario A: Deletion NOT committed (Local changes)
- To restore ALL modified/deleted files in the current directory and subdirectories:
  git restore .
  # OR (older syntax)
  git checkout .

- To restore specific multiple files/folders:
  git restore file1.txt folderA/ file2.js

Scenario B: Deletion COMMITTED (Restore from history/remote)
- You can list multiple paths in the checkout command:
  git checkout <commit_hash_or_branch> -- file1.txt src/folderA/ file2.js
  
  Example (restore from main branch):
  git checkout origin/main -- component1.js component2.js utils/
